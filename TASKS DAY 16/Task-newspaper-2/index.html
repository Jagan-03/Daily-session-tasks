                            Messi's 14th-minute goal from outside the box put him level with Pele and he broke the record in the second half. <br><br>
                            The 34-year-old dribbled past a defender for his second goal before completing a hat-trick from a rebound two minutes before full-time.

                    Jack Grealish scored a wonderful goal on his Champions League debut as Manchester City scored six past RB Leipzig to put the pain of losing last season's final behind them. <br><br>
                    City produced a stunning attacking display to overcome last season's Bundesliga runners-up and get their Group A campaign off to a winning start. <br><br>
                    Grealish, the British record £100m signing from Aston Villa, illuminated Etihad Stadium after cutting inside from the left before curling home to make it 4-2. <br><br>
                    In an extraordinary game, Nathan Ake had put Pep Guardiola's side ahead with a powerful header - the 10th different player to score in a City shirt this season - before a calamitous own goal by Nordi Mukiele doubled the lead.
